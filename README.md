# Fraser Raney . Jarvis Consulting

I'm a software developer with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Queen's University and a Bachelor's from Trent University. My experience spans academic research in machine learning for medical imaging and hands-on software development in industry, including work on geophysical interpretation tools at Lamontagne Geophysics. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through technology-whether optimizing code, designing intuitive systems, or exploring tools like cloud computing and AI. What excites me most is the constant opportunity to innovate and make meaningful contributions through software.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FraserRaney](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FraserRaney)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FraserRaney/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a scalable Linux-cluster monitoring system using Bash scripts and crontab to log CPU, memory, and disk metrics, storing data in a PostgreSQL database within Docker; enables usage tracking and real-time cluster health visibility via SQL.

**SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FraserRaney/tree/master/sql)]: Practiced SQL fundamentals using pgAdmin 4 and a Docker-based PostgreSQL 16 (Alpine) instance: created DDL tables via ddl.sql, loaded test data with clubdata.sql, then executed analytical SQL queries involving joins, aggregation, filtering, and string manipulation to reinforce relational database concepts.


## Highlighted Projects
**JavaFX Snake Game with Score Database** [[GitHub](https://github.com/studentuser13/Examples/tree/main/JavaFX%20Snake%20Game%20with%20Score%20Database)]: Developed a JavaFX snake game featuring real-time scoring and persistent high-score storage: built using Java and JavaFX for GUI, a relational database (e.g., SQLite/PostgreSQL) for score tracking, and Git version control. Implements collision detection, dynamic growth mechanics, and SQL integration to reinforce game logic and data-persistence concepts.

**Prostate CT Segmentation Using UNet** [[GitHub](https://github.com/studentuser13/Examples/tree/main/Prostate%20CT%20Segmentation%20Using%20UNet%20(Colab%20Notebook))]: Developed a UNet-based deep learning model for prostate segmentation in CT scans using Python and PyTorch on Google Colab. Implemented data preprocessing with NumPy, SimpleITK, and scikit-learn; trained and evaluated on GPU to demonstrate semantic segmentation, visualization, and model performance in a medical imaging context.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2025-present)**: Collaborated using Agile/Scrum methodology to deliver back-end and data projects. Gained hands-on experience with Linux/Shell, SQL, Git, Docker, SDLC practices, and workflows for real-world enterprise environments.

**Software Developer, Lamontagne Geophysics Ltd. (2022-2024)**: Developed and enhanced geological-interpretation web applications using Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, d3.js, and Three.js; implemented dynamic UI controls, offline caching with service workers, and prototype migration to React/TypeScript. Debugged visualization software, documented code changes, and updated manuals.
